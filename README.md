# CS180/280A Portfolio Site

This is a lightweight, pretty GitHub Pages site for your course projects.

## Quick Start
1. Create a new GitHub repository (public is fine for Pages).
2. Download `cs180_280a_site.zip` from ChatGPT and unzip it.
3. Copy the files into your repo and commit to the **main** branch.
4. In **Settings → Pages**, set:
   - **Source**: `Deploy from a branch`
   - **Branch**: `main` / `/root`
5. Wait for GitHub Pages to build, then open your site URL.

### Customize
- Landing page: edit `index.html` (project cards, descriptions, etc.).
- Styling: tweak `assets/style.css`.
- Project 0 page: edit `project0.html`. Replace placeholder image `src` with your files, or put your media in `assets/project0/` keeping the same names.
- Add your name / course info anywhere you like in the header/footer.

### Folder tips
You can keep your images in:
```
assets/project0/part1-close.jpg
assets/project0/part1-zoom.jpg
assets/project0/part2-tele.jpg
assets/project0/part2-wide.jpg
assets/project0/dolly.gif
assets/project0/dolly-01.jpg
assets/project0/dolly-02.jpg
```
(Or change the `src` paths in the HTML.)

Have fun! ✨
